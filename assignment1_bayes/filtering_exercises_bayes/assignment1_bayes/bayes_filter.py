        TODO: Implement the Bayes Filter prediction step.

        This method should implement the prediction step of the Bayes filter by applying
        the motion model to update beliefs about the robot's position. The motion model
        should account for uncertainty in the robot's heading and possibility of failed actions.

        Implementation steps:
        1. Create a new belief array to store updated beliefs:
           - Initialize with zeros: new_belief = np.zeros_like(self.belief)

        2. For each cell (i,j) in the grid with non-zero belief:
           - If action is forward (action == 0):
             * Consider all possible headings (right, up, left, down)
             * For each heading:
               - Calculate next position based on heading
               - If move is valid (in bounds and not obstacle):
                 * Add probability of successful move to new position
                 * Add probability of failed move to current position
             * Use self.motion_noise for probability of failed move
             * Use (1 - self.motion_noise) for probability of successful move
             * Assume uniform distribution over headings (0.25 each)
           - If action is turn (action != 0):
             * Simply copy current belief (no position change)

        3. Normalize the new belief:
           - If sum is positive, divide by sum
           - Store result in self.belief

        Key variables:
        - self.belief: Current belief state (2D array)

        This method should implement the update step of the Bayes filter using sensor

        the expected readings for each possible position and heading.

             * Compare with actual readings:
               - For each pair of expected and actual readings:
                 * If difference < self.measurement_tolerance:
                   - Multiply by (1 - self.measurement_noise)

             * Average likelihood over all headings (multiply by 0.25)
           - Store final likelihood in likelihood array
